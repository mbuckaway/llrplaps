# llrplaps
LLRP Based Lap Counter/Timer for a Velodrome

Using the LLRPToolkit (which uses the libXML and libXSD projects), the QT library, and the CMake build system, the project
aims to develop a system to maintain a database of user and RFID chips which riders on a velodrome will have their
laps counted and stats acculated.

Complete documentation for the project, including building the code and prereqs, are on the WIKI pages.
